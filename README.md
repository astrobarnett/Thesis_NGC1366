# Thesis_NGC1366
The NGC 1366 is a lenticular and bright galaxy at a distance of 17Mpc in the Fornax cluster. It is a challenging case in the panorama of galaxies hosting counter-rotating stellar components. Surprisingly, unlike most of the counterrotating galaxies, the ionized gas detected in NGC 1366 is not associated with any of its stellar components nor with the main galaxy body, but it has a chaotic distribution and convulsed kinematics with multiple velocity components observed along the minor axis of the galaxy.

The aim of this thesis work is to study the ionized gas in NGC 1366 with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) data. To study the gas and its characteristics, I have used Python programming and examined the 2D maps of emission line flux, relative velocity and velocity dispersion of the ionized gas and the properties of the gas.

Results: The ionized gas has irregular motion at the center of the galaxy. The emission lines appear to be in an irregular spiral pattern in the whole
galaxy. Furthermore, The [NII] and [OIII] are brighter than the Hβ and Hα indicating that there is no star formation in the galaxy. This confirms
the peculiarities of NGC 1366 in comparison with the other counter-rotating galaxies.
